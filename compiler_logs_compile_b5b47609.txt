RESPONSE:
Certainly! Below is a step-by-step execution plan for the PySpark transformation to show all orders, considering the provided schema and identified joins.

### Execution Plan

1. **Load the Necessary Tables:**
   - Load the `orders` table into a DataFrame named `orders_df`.
   - Load the `order_items` table into a DataFrame named `order_items_df`.
   - Load the `order_history` table into a DataFrame named `order_history_df`.

2. **Transformations and Joins:**
   - **Join `orders` and `order_items`:**
     - Perform an inner join between `orders_df` and `order_items_df` on the `order_id` column. This will combine order details with their respective items.
     - Resulting DataFrame: `orders_items_joined_df`.

   - **Join `orders_items_joined_df` with `order_history`:**
     - Perform an inner join between `orders_items_joined_df` and `order_history_df` on the `order_id` column from `orders_df` and `id` column from `order_history_df`.
     - Resulting DataFrame: `complete_orders_df`.

3. **Select and Rename Columns:**
   - Select the necessary columns from `complete_orders_df` to form the final output. This may include:
     - `orders.order_id`
     - `orders.customer_id`
     - `orders.order_date`
     - `orders.total_amount`
     - `order_items.product_id`
     - `order_items.quantity`
     - `order_items.price_per_unit`
     - `order_history.order_value`
     - `order_history.order_date` (renamed to avoid confusion with `orders.order_date`)

4. **Order of Operations:**
   - Start by loading the tables.
   - Perform the first join between `orders` and `order_items`.
   - Perform the second join with `order_history`.
   - Select and rename the necessary columns for clarity and to avoid ambiguity.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The final output should be a DataFrame that includes all relevant order information, combining details from `orders`, `order_items`, and `order_history`.
   - Ensure that the column names are clear and non-conflicting, especially for date fields.

### Summary

The execution plan involves loading the necessary tables into DataFrames, performing a series of joins to combine order details with item and history information, and selecting the relevant columns for the final output. The process ensures that all orders are displayed with comprehensive details from the related tables, providing a complete view of each order's information.

    PostgreSQL Connection Details:
    Host: host.docker.internal
    Port: 5432
    Database: postgres
    User: postgres
    Password: postgres
    
    Table Information:
    
Table: orders
Columns:
- order_id: integer
- customer_id: integer
- order_date: date
- total_amount: double precision
Primary Keys: order_id
Foreign Keys:
- customer_id references customers.customer_id


Table: order_items
Columns:
- item_id: integer
- order_id: integer
- product_id: integer
- quantity: integer
- price_per_unit: double precision
Primary Keys: item_id
Foreign Keys:
- order_id references orders.order_id
- product_id references products.product_id


Table: order_history
Columns:
- id: integer
- user_id: integer
- order_value: numeric
- order_date: timestamp without time zone
Primary Keys: id
Foreign Keys:
- user_id references users.id


    IMPORTANT SCHEMA DETAILS:
    - The "customers" table has columns: customer_id, name, email, country (it does NOT have first_name/last_name)
    - The "orders" table has columns: order_id, customer_id, order_date, total_amount
    - Joins must use qualified column references, e.g., customers_df["customer_id"] == orders_df["customer_id"]
    - Use F.col() for column references in aggregations, e.g., F.sum(F.col("total_amount"))
    
    Guidelines for implementation:
    1. Use PySpark SQL functions (import as F) and DataFrame operations
    2. Load data from PostgreSQL using JDBC
    3. Implement the transformation following the execution plan
    4. Make sure to handle errors gracefully
    5. Store the FINAL result in a DataFrame variable named 'result_df'
    6. Make sure to select appropriate columns in the final result
    7. For joins, explicitly specify join columns with equality conditions and ALWAYS include the join type
    8. Document your code with clear comments
    
    IMPORTANT: For a complete implementation, include:
    1. Necessary imports
    2. SparkSession creation (but make it optional/commented out as it may already exist)
    3. JDBC connection details
    4. Table loading functions
    5. All transformation steps
    6. Final result selection
    7. Result display (result_df.show())
    
    Provide clean, production-quality code.
